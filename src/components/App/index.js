// . If a user is authenticated, store it in the local state and pass the authenticated user object down to all components that are interested in it. Otherwise, pass the authenticated user down as null. That way, all components interested in it can adjust their behavior (e.g. use conditional rendering) based on the session state. For instance, the Navigation component is interested because it has to show different options to authenticated and non authenticated users. The SignOut component shouldnâ€™t show up for a non authenticated user, for example.



// The helper function onAuthStateChanged() receives a function as parameter that has access to the authenticated user. Also, the passed function is called every time something changes for the authenticated user. It is called when a user signs up, signs in, and signs out. If a user signs out, the authUser object becomes null, so the authUser property in the local state is set to null and all components depending on it adjust their behavior (e.g. display different options like the Navigation component).
